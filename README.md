I work on evaluating language technologies for societal, cultural, and ethical considerations. I bring together quantitative evaluation and qualitative methods to understand how language, technology, and society interact and shape each other, ultimately developing technology that can positively impact diverse user groups.

Currently, I am a second-year PhD student at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I am advised by Fernando Diaz. I have also interned at Semantic Scholar at the Allen Institute for AI. 
Before my PhD, I have spend time at Google Research India and Microsoft Research India working on fairness and evaluation in multilingual and multicultural contexts. I graduated from BITS Pilani with a B.E. in Computer Science in 2021.
