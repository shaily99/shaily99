I am a second-year PhD student at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I am advised by Fernando Diaz. I work on evaluating language technologies for societal, cultural, and ethical considerations. I bring together quantitative evaluation and qualitative methods to understand how language, technology, and society interact and shape each other, ultimately developing technology that can positively impact diverse user groups.

During my PhD, I interned at Semantic Scholar at the Allen Institute for AI, with Maria Antoniak and Tal August working on a mixed-methods project to understand how interdisciplinary researchers adapt their writing for different research cultures and whether language technologies can support this process. 

Before my PhD, I was a Predoctoral Researcher working at the NLU Group at Google Research, India. I worked with Partha Talukdar and Vinodkumar Prabhakaran on bias and fairness in multilingual models in the Indian cultural context. Before that, I spent a year at Microsoft Research, India working with Sunayana Sitaram and Monojit Choudhary on interpretable evaluation of multilingual NLP models. I graduated from BITS Pilani with a B.E. in Computer Science in 2021. During my undergrad, I worked on multimodal fake news detection, knowledge-based fact verification, and domain adaptation.
